# Capture the packets
1. Navigate to the HTTPeek module. If not showing on the left side of the screen, look for it under *Modules & Packages*.
2. Select *wlan 0* and the interface, and *Very very verbose* as the verbosity.
3. Start capturing packets. You must stay in that same page or HTTPeek will stop capturing packets.

# Analyze the packets
1. When done capturing packets, download the file.
2. To analyze it, use your favorite packet analysis tool. I recommend *Network Miner* for this.
